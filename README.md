# Ebay_Car_Data_RLD
I am using the Pandas and NumPy libaries to analyze automobile brand data which includes sales price per car, kilometers driven, and top selling automobile brands.  The dataset was pulled from Kaggle.

The purpose of the this project is to showcase my skills within Python and how I can manipulate and clean a dataset appropriately.
