### -- Project Status: Completed
Project Intro/Objective

I have been provided a dataset from Kaggle that outlines eBay sales date on German automobiles.  The purpose of this project is to clean this dataset and make it more presentable. I will be putting this dataset into multiple dataframes to calculate summary statistics.  My goal is to provide useful insights for anyone who is looking to purchase automobiles from eBay.

### Project Description

Using the csv file provided to me from Kaggle, I will start by putting the dataset into a Pandas dataframe.  All info about categorical and numerical columns will be explored.  Columns that are in camelcase will be changed to snakecase.  There will be cases where columns will need to be converted from objects and string types to numeric types.  In addition, I will be providing summary statistics in my final dataframe.  


### Columns Explored

    * price = The price of each automobile listed
    * odometer_km = Number of km the automobile as racked up
    * registration_year = The year in which the automobile was first registered
    * brand = Automobile manufacturer
    * date_crawled = The date when the ad was first crawled
    * ad_created = The date when the ad on eBay was first submitted
    * last_seen = The date when the crawler last saw the ad online

### Summary Statistics

    * Top 10 Brands
    * Average Price Per Brand
    * Average Number of Kilometers Driven

## Needs of this project
